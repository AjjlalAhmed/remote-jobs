# remote-jobs

remote-jobs is a simple, easy-to-use REST API that returns JSON results of job posting. 

I create this api because i need this api in my other project Docbydev.

Its fetech job posting from other's site by scrapinig their content with the help of node, express, puppeteer, node-html-parser and sqlite.

In this project, i lerned how to use sqlite and node-html-parser with node and express.
